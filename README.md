## Overview

This project creates a build of the latest [WASMEdge](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge) enabled [crun release](https://github.com/containers/crun).

This build is then bundled into a vendored container along with an executable to help with the deployment.

Finally there is a helm chart to deploy it into managed kubernetes services.

The deployment is performed copying files to 3 locations on each node:

1. The `/lib` folder to copy the shared objects `libwasmedge.so.0`

2. The `/usr/local/sbin` folder to deploy the `crun` executable

3. The additional runtime is added to either the `crio.conf` or the containerd `config.toml`

4. Uninstall performs a rollback of the CRI configuration.

N.B. Red Hat Core OS based instances have still to be tested and we expect some issues modifying the crio config and copying the WASM libs to the host.
