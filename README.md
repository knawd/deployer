# deployer

Deploy a Web Assembly enabled container runtime into kubernetes to enable the use of WASM services in public, private and edge scenarios.

See https://knawd.dev for more information on how to build Web Assembly services using this system.

## Overview

This project deploys a custom build of the latest [crun release](https://github.com/containers/crun) with [WASMEdge](https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge)/[wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/)/[wasm-nodejs](https://github.com/mhdawson/crun/tree/node-wasm-experiment) support and provides a helm chart and executable to assist with the deployment.

## Install

Please see the instructions in [the helm chart README](https://github.com/knawd/deployer/blob/main/charts/knawd-deployer/README.md).

The node configuration is preformed by a container deployed on each node by the daemonset. 

The container copies files to 3 locations on each node, restarts the container runtime service (crio or containerd) and applies a knative configuration:

1. The `/lib` or `/lib64` folder contains the shared objects `libwasmedge.so.0` or `libwasmtime.so` or `libnode.so`

1. The `/usr/local/sbin` folder to deploy the OCI executable e.g. `crun`

1. The additional runtime configuration is added to either the `crio.conf` or the containerd `config.toml`

1. The namespace role grants access to the host system while the cluster roles grants access to the config map resources.

### Secuirty Considerations

* The daemonset requires access to the host OS and uses the hostpid to restart the host runtimes

* A cluster role is used to update config maps

* It's strongly recommended that no other workloads are deployed into the same namespace

## Supported Versions

### Runtimes
|Release|WASMEdge|WASMtime|node-wasm|crun|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|v1.2.0|0.11.2|5.0.0|[experiment](https://github.com/mhdawson/crun/commit/23f346e3bc15ec7e6188b405df895aef5a5cbcdd)|[1.8](https://github.com/containers/crun/releases/tag/1.8)|

### Kubernetes Versions
|Ubuntu|OpenShift|microk8s|microshift|
|---|---|---|---|
|18.04, 20.04|4.10, 4.11|1.26.1|4.12|

N.B. Red Hat Core OS based instances have still to be tested and we expect some issues modifying the crio config and copying the WASM libs to the host.

### CPU Architectures
|amd64|arm64|ppc64|
|---|---|---|
|:green_circle:|:green_circle:|:red_circle:|

N.B. Work on [nodejs-wasm](https://github.com/knawd/deployer/pull/11) may provide support for ppc64.
